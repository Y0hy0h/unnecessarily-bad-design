{"body":"\nWhen you are approaching a traffic light that is currently green, I have no indication of when it will turn red. I feel nervous because if it turns red, I need to quickly judge whether I can make it across in time. And the switch is sudden, with only a short, yellow grace period.\n\nSimilarly, when sitting---or standing---at a red light I get impatient because I need to keep watching the light but nothing happens for quite a while.\n\n|> Heading\n    How to fix it\n\nIndicate the remaining time for the current phase. Either use a seconds countdown next to the light, or some other more approximate indicator like a circle that drains similar to a clock's handles.\n\nNot only can driver's easily judge whether they can make it across a green light, pedestrians know they can answer this text while waiting for a green light.","staticData":{}}
