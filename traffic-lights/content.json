But will I make it onto the crossing in time?\n\nWhen I am approaching a traffic light that is currently green, I feel nervous because it might turn red at any moment and I'd suddenly have to stop.\n\nSimilarly, when sitting---or standing---at a red light I get impatient because I need to keep watching the light but nothing happens for quite a while.\n\n|> Heading\n    How to fix it\n\nIndicate the remaining time for the current phase. Either use a seconds countdown next to the light, or some other more approximate indicator like a circle that drains similar to a clock's handles.\n\nThen not only can drivers easily judge whether they can make it across a green light without a forceful break, pedestrians know they can answer this text while waiting for a green light.","staticData":{}}
