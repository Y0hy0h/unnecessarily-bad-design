{"body":"\nI sometimes run into a door, because I try to push it, but it only can be pulled. Or the opposite.\n\nThey know about this problem. They stick labels on the doors that tell us what to do. And I /still/ get it wrong. So labels don't solve the problem with misleading doors. `Such doors are [called Norman doors]{link|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/article/norman-doors-dont-know-whether-push-pull-blame-design/} after [Don Norman]{link|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman} who discusses them as the very first problem in his book [The Design of Everyday Things]{link|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things} (ISBN 978-0-465-05065-9).`{note}\n\n|> Heading\n    How to fix it\n\nDon't have handles that I need to grip. Have a flat plate for pushing, and a kind of flap for pulling.\n\nIf you need a lock and thus a lever handle, use other hints. For example if the door hangs visibly before the frame, I won't try pushing it.\n\nFortunately, when lives are at stake, this is done right; emergency doors often have a horizontal bar that you push. Less stylish, but saves lives.\n\n|> Image\n    src=images/door-handles/emergency-exit.jpg\n    alt=A double door with signs stating “Do not block.
