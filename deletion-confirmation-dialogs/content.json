{"body":"\n\"Are you sure you want to delete this?\" Yes, of course. I rarely click the delete button by accident. So now I'm used to just always clicking yes.\n\nBut sometimes I then notice that I deleted the wrong thing. Great. Because I always click yes, I do it without thinking much. And so the dialog does not prevent me from deleting the wrong thing.\n\n|> Heading\n    How to fix it\n\nDo not ask for confirmation. Offer undo.\n\nSome services, like [Google Keep]{link|url=https://keep.google.com}, already do this. Deleting is quick and easy, and if I delete something by accident, no worries, I restore it immediately.","staticData":{}}
