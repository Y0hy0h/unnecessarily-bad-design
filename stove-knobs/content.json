And I can't feel what plate a knob is controlling. So of course I will guess wrong sometimes. `This issue is described in [Don Norman]{link|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman}'s book [The Design of Everyday Things]{link|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things} (ISBN 978-0-465-05065-9, pp. 113--115).`{note}\n\n|> Heading\n    How to fix it\n\nArrange them pysically similar to the heating plates. Those that control plates in the back should be higher than those controlling plates in the front.\n\nEven if you don't have the space to arrange the knobs in a vertical grid just like the plates, you can at least put some slightly higher then the other ones, for example by putting their labels below them.","staticData":{}}
