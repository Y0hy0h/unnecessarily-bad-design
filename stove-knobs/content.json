They control an arbitrary one of the plates.\n\n|> Heading\n    How to fix it\n\nArrange them the same as the heating plates. Those that control plates in the back should be higher than those controlling plates in the front.\n\nEven if you don't have the space to arrange the knobs in a grid just like the plates, you can at least put some slightly higher then the other ones.","staticData":{}}
